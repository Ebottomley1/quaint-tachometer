         <p>Ed's Weiners was founded by Edward Bottomley in Salisbury, Maryland in February of 2017. The idea spawned when his Info 301 teacher made him complete a project, in which he had to create a fake website. He decided he wanted to make a company focused around one of his true loves: food! 'But what kind of food?' he asked himself. Hotdogs! Ed decided that hotdogs were easy enough for him to make on his own in large quantities and it allowed him to make a funny, crude-looking name for his company. Today, you can enjoy five different wieners, all handmade by Ed himself! So go ahead, put an Ed's Wiener in your mouth!</p>
